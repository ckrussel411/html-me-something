        A Curious Teenager
    </h3>
        <p>
        I was born of mixed races and grew up in America.  My mother was Thai and my father was American.
        Growing up, I had never really known much about my mother's side of the family or her culture.
        Around the time I turned 17, my interest started to pique.  We had always spent time with my father's
        family, but I knew virtually nothing about my mother's family.  After working as a bus boy in a restaurant for
        several years and saving money, I decided use that money to visit Thailand and meet my mother's family.

    <h3>
        Culture Shock
    </h3>
        <p>
        When I arrived in Thailand, it was nothing like I had ever seen.  The architecture, the people, even the vehicles
        were different than what I was used to.  Being 17, I had hardly traveled outside of Missouri!  What I discovered
        in Thailand was that the architecture, landscape and food were all beautiful.  Buddhist style temples lined the cities
        and countrysides.  Intricate statues and creations were abundant.  Beautiful palm trees and plantlife unfamiliar in America
        were everywhere.  In the cities, delicacies like fried jellyfish and pig intestine could be purchased from a streetside vendor.  Most street
        food could be purchased for &#3647 40! (Roughly 1 USD).  The tropical climate allowed for vast plant and wildlife and the heat was unlike anything in the United States.  It was very early
        in my trip that I realized I had come a <strong>very</strong> long way!

    <h3>
        Bangkok
    </h3>
        <p>
        The first place we visited was Bangkok, Thailand's capital city.  Much larger and livelier than St. Louis, I had to become accustomed
        to public transportation and the fast pace very quickly.  The city was constantly busy and people were always moving.  We went to several
        shops and restaurants where I began to decide what culinary delights I liked and disliked.  I had several fantastic meals but some things
        I just couldn't stomach... like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian">Durian</a>.  I met several relatives in Bangkok for the very first time.
        In an attempt to make me feel at home, my uncle ordered KFC and Pizza Hut for me.  While I wasn't interested, I was hungry.  It was interesting to taste
        the difference between Thai fast food and American fast food.  We then visited several tourist destinations such as temples and historic landmarks.  After a few days,
        the city had become stressful and I was ready to see more of the country.

    <h3>
        Korat
    </h3>
        <p>After several days of the big city and the beach and several other sites, I was able to visit my mother's hometown and the house where she grew up.
            This was also the town in which my parents had met.  My father was stationed in Korat, Thailand during the Vietnam War as a USAF pilot.  My mother
            had been working at the officer's station when my father met her.  I also met several aunts and uncles and cousins and also got to see my grandparents'
            burial site.  The town itself was similar to Bangkok but my mother's village was a small, remote setting in the hills of Central Thailand.  It was wonderful
            to meet family I hadn't met in 17 years as well as to get away from the city and the touristy locations for a few days.
